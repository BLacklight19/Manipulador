# Trajectory Control with 5-DOF Manipulator

This repo contains the simulation and control algorithms of my undergraduate thesis project: [Five Degree of Freedom Manipulator Positioning Interface for Subsea Applications](https://www.maxwell.vrac.puc-rio.br/colecao.php?strSecao=resultado&nrSeq=53802@2), which uses the ARM 5E Mini manipulator from ECA Robotics.

It's composed by three folders:

- Matlab: Theoretical simulations of the manipulator's kinematic model;
- Python: Trajectory control and data send/receive algorithms to/from the manipulator;
- Trajectory Points: Set of points og three different trajectories to be coursed by the manipulator.
